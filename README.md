## About Me
***
Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has been an enlightening and transformative journey. This process has not only allowed me to showcase my technical skills and strengths but also helped me clarify my professional goals and values, preparing me to contribute effectively in the computer science field.

One of the key aspects I’ve learned is the importance of collaboration in a team environment. Throughout various projects, I have collaborated with classmates to build software solutions. For example, when creating my first MEAN project, many students collaborated throughout the weeks when faced with errors or unclear instructions. This experience helped me develop strong communication and coordination skills, ensuring that each piece of the project from different sources fit together seamlessly. These experiences have shaped my understanding of teamwork and its importance in creating scalable, maintainable systems.

In addition to collaboration, I have also honed my communication skills with stakeholders. I have had opportunities to present project proposals and solutions to both technical and non-technical audiences. A key example is when I had to explain the benefits of having both local and cloud storage for a native app to a group of stakeholders unfamiliar with the technology. By simplifying the explanation and focusing on the real-world impact, I was able to effectively convey the importance of the system to the project’s success. This skill has been crucial in ensuring that everyone involved, regardless of their technical background, understands the value and functionality of the software solutions being developed.

In terms of technical skills, I have gained significant expertise in data structures and algorithms. From designing efficient search algorithms for my Capstone project to optimizing data retrieval times using pagination, I’ve applied these concepts to build responsive and performance-oriented applications. My experience has allowed me to not only understand these structures theoretically but also to implement and modify them to solve real-world problems.

Software engineering and database management have been central to many of my projects. For instance, I successfully implemented a full-stack web application for an animal rescue organization, using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This project required careful database schema design, the creation of REST APIs, and the integration of user authentication features. These experiences have deepened my understanding of how various components in a web application interact and have prepared me for software development roles in the industry.

Lastly, my coursework in security has been invaluable. I completed a cybersecurity certification, which taught me about IAM (Identity and Access Management) and common vulnerabilities in web applications. Applying these principles in my own projects, I ensured that user data was protected through encryption, proper authentication, and secure handling of sensitive information, which are critical components in today’s software systems.

Together, these experiences have provided me with a broad yet cohesive skill set. Each artifact included in this portfolio reflects a different aspect of my expertise and showcases the depth of my understanding in various areas of computer science. Whether it’s building scalable software, designing secure systems, or working as part of a collaborative team, my portfolio is a testament to my readiness for the challenges and opportunities ahead in this field.

## Capstone Project
***
My final enhancement is my full-stack web app. While its front end is hosted on GitHub Pages, the back end is hosted on Render.com (free account). Click the image below, and give the web app roughly 50 seconds to spin the backend up. It will be much snappier afterward.

## Code Review
***
In my code review of the original artifact, I analyzed the structure, highlighted strengths like effective functions and coding standards, and identified areas for improvement such as performance, readability, and algorithm efficiency. This review not only showcased my strengths but also provided valuable insights into how I can elevate the overall quality of my code in future projects.

## Original Artifact
***
My CS-499 Capstone Project originated from a previous project created in a earlier course CS-340. The original artifact was a Jupyter dashboard connected to a local MongoDB database displaying a table of thousands of animals with details about each animal, a map of the selected animal’s location, and a pie chart of dog breed information.
I was asked to enhance the artifact in three key areas:
  - Software Engineering and Design
  - Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Databases

## Enhancements
***
### Software Engineering and Design
This enhancement involved turning the existing simple dashboard project written in Python and HTML into a full-stack web application. I accomplished this enhancement using a different language stack, MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js otherwise known as the (MERN) stack. Including designing a new user-friendly Graphic User Interface (GUI) showing each animal as a card, and a login feature.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
This enhancement involved adding a search feature and creating a pagination component allowing users to page through the database of animals. Asynchronous calls for data fetching, along with pagination will increase efficiency by fetching data in chunks instead of the entire dataset at once. The search feature will allow for a faster more practical method of searching for an animal leading to a better user experience.

### Databases
This enhancement involves implementing data mining and changing from a locally hosted MongoDB database to a cloud-hosted database (MongoDB Atlas). Data mining will reveal insights about the data while a cloud-hosted database will allow for more scalability with computing power, storage, security, and more.
