## About Me
This is the section about me.

## Capstone Project
My Full-Stack Web App's frontend is hosted on Github Pages, while the backend is hosted on Render.com (free account). Click the image below, and give the web app roughly 50 seconds to spin the backend up. It will be much snappier afterward.

## Code Review
In my code review of the original artifact, I analyzed the structure, highlighted strengths like effective functions and coding standards, and identified areas for improvement such as performance, readability, and algorithm efficiency. This review not only showcased my strengths but also provided valuable insights into how I can elevate the overall quality of my code in future projects.

## Original Artifact
My CS-499 Capstone Project originated from a previous project created in a earlier course CS-340. The original artifact was a Jupyter dashboard connected to a local MongoDB database displaying a table of thousands of animals with details about each animal, a map of the selected animal’s location, and a pie chart of dog breed information.
I was asked to enhance the artifact in three key areas:
  - Software Engineering and Design
  - Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Databases
