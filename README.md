## Capstone Project
[![Rescue A Pet Capstone Project](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7605934a-f896-4a8c-b09d-ae0e15cfe36c)](https://tekibotz.github.io/)

## Code Review

## Original Artifact
My CS-499 Capstone Project originated from a previous project created in a earlier course CS-340. The original artifact was a Jupyter dashboard connected to a local MongoDB database displaying a table of thousands of animals with details about each animal, a map of the selected animal’s location, and a pie chart of dog breed information.
I was asked to enhance the artifact in three key areas:
  - Software Engineering and Design
  - Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Databases
