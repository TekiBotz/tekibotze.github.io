## About Me
***
This is the section about me.

## Capstone Project
***
My Full-Stack Web App's frontend is hosted on GitHub Pages, while the backend is hosted on Render.com (free account). Click the image below, and give the web app roughly 50 seconds to spin the backend up. It will be much snappier afterward.

## Code Review
***
In my code review of the original artifact, I analyzed the structure, highlighted strengths like effective functions and coding standards, and identified areas for improvement such as performance, readability, and algorithm efficiency. This review not only showcased my strengths but also provided valuable insights into how I can elevate the overall quality of my code in future projects.

## Original Artifact
***
My CS-499 Capstone Project originated from a previous project created in a earlier course CS-340. The original artifact was a Jupyter dashboard connected to a local MongoDB database displaying a table of thousands of animals with details about each animal, a map of the selected animalâ€™s location, and a pie chart of dog breed information.
I was asked to enhance the artifact in three key areas:
  - Software Engineering and Design
  - Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Databases

## Enhancements
***
### Software Engineering and Design
This enhancement involved turning the existing simple dashboard project written in Python and HTML into a full-stack web application. I accomplished this enhancement using a different language stack, MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js otherwise known as the (MERN) stack. Including designing a new user-friendly Graphic User Interface (GUI) showing each animal as a card, and a login feature.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
This enhancement involved adding a search feature and creating a pagination component allowing users to page through the database of animals. Asynchronous calls for data fetching, along with pagination will increase efficiency by fetching data in chunks instead of the entire dataset at once. The search feature will allow for a faster more practical method of searching for an animal leading to a better user experience.

### Databases
This enhancement involves implementing data mining and changing from a locally hosted MongoDB database to a cloud-hosted database (MongoDB Atlas). Data mining will reveal insights about the data while a cloud-hosted database will allow for more scalability with computing power, storage, security, and more.
